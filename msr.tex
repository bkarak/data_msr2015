\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
 
Software metrics provide a means to extract useful and measurable information about the structure of a software system. Since software artefacts consist of digital data, many of their aspects are easily measured. This explains why the first metrics like LOC (Lines Of Code) and CLOC (Comment Lines of Code) appeared very early. Over the years, a wealth of different metrics has appeared in the literature \cite{GUSC07,BBM96,LOKI94,HK81,BDM97} and some of them, like Chidamber and Kemerer \cite{CHKE94} have found their way in software development practice and tools.

Today a software engineer or developer has a very large list of metrics at his disposition in order to gain the required insight for understanding and evaluating the size, complexity and overall structure of a system. This has led researchers to try to discover which set of metrics is most appropriate for each environment \cite{XSZC00,PUVA03,MAHA99,BRCA94}. There also exist metrics that can be used to evaluate other aspects of a system, such as the process that was used to develop it.

\section{On the Use of Domain Specific Languages}
\label{sec:dsl}

The Java Platform exists more than a decade and provides a development environment for several application areas, such as web, grid computing, and traditional client-server applications. The official development environment of the Java platform is released by Oracle and is widely-known as the Java Standard Edition {\sc dsk}. The process of development and innovation in the Java ecosystem is built around a community, that writes proposals of features, known as {\sc jsr}s (Java Specification Requests), which are supported by prototype implementations.

In the literature, it is referred that {\sc dsl}s are used to reduce software development cost, by introducing domain efficiency \cite{MHS05}. This thesis focuses on practical research aspects as well as with the theoretical ones; thus the first problem that needs to be examined, is to measure the adoption of {\sc dsl}s in software projects. In addition, the average number of {\sc dsl}s usually used in a software project needs to be investigated.

The methodology was the following; A set of standard {\sc dsl} application libraries was identified, and the source was scanned for specific \textit{import} statements e.g. \textit{java.util.regex}, which indicated that the standard package that implements regular expressions was used, thus regular expressions were used. If a package is detected in the source code, then the project will be tagged that it uses one (1) {\sc dsl}. Consequently, if a project has {\sc dsl} count four (4), then it means that four (4) different application libraries were detected during the source code scan. Table \ref{tbl:dsl-list} lists the selected {\sc dsl}s application libraries. Note that all these libraries are included as part of the Java {\sc sdk}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{List of selected DSL application libraries}
\label{tbl:dsl-list}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
 \hline
\textbf{DSL} & \textbf{Java Package}\\
\hline
Regular Expressions & \verb|java.util.regex|\\
XML & \verb|javax.xml|, \verb|org.w3c| and \verb|org.xml|\\
SQL & \verb|java.sql| and \verb|javax.sql|\\
XPath & \verb|java.xml.xpath|\\
XSLT & \verb|javax.xml.transform|\\
RTF & \verb|javax.swing.text.rtf|\\
HTML & \verb|javax.swing.text.html|\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The initial goal of this experiment was simply to provide quantifiable results that are indicative regarding the usage of each {\sc dsl}, thus only files containing Java code were taken into account. Build files or other resources that may contain {\sc dsl}s were not included.

One final assumption was also made; if {\sc xpath} or {\sc xslt} were found in the source code, then the project would be marked that it also uses {\sc xml}, since those two languages are used for query and transformations on {\sc xml} {\sc dom} trees.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rel}

The Maven ecosystem has been previously analyzed by Raemaekers et al.~\cite{RDV13} to produce the {\it Maven dependency dataset}. Apart from basic information like individual methods, classes, packages and lines of code for every {\sc jar}, this dataset also includes a database with all the connections between the aforementioned elements. Our work differs from this research because it reports all bugs coming from the output of a static analysis tool, for each {\sc jar} contained in the Maven repository.
