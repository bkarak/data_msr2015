\section{On the Use of Domain Specific Languages}
\label{sec:dsl}

The Java Platform exists more than a decade and provides a development environment for several application areas, such as web, grid computing, and traditional client-server applications. The official development environment of the Java platform is released by Oracle and is widely-known as the Java Standard Edition SDK. The process of development and innovation in the Java ecosystem is built around a community, that writes proposals of features, known as {\sc jsr}s (Java Specification Requests), which are supported by prototype implementations.

In the literature, it is referred that {\sc dsl}s are used to reduce software development cost, by introducing domain efficiency \cite{MHS05}. This thesis focuses on practical research aspects as well as with the theoretical ones; thus the first problem that needs to be examined, is to measure the adoption of {\sc dsl}s in software projects. In addition, the average number of {\sc dsl}s usually used in a software project needs to be investigated.

The methodology was the following; A set of standard {\sc dsl} application libraries was identified, and the source was scanned for specific \textit{import} statements e.g. \textit{java.util.regex}, which indicated that the standard package that implements regular expressions was used, thus regular expressions were used. If a package is detected in the source code, then the project will be tagged that it uses one (1) {\sc dsl}. Consequently, if a project has {\sc dsl} count four (4), then it means that four (4) different application libraries were detected during the source code scan. Table \ref{tbl:dsl-list} lists the selected {\sc dsl}s application libraries. Note that all these libraries are included as part of the Java {\sc sdk}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{List of selected DSL application libraries}
\label{tbl:dsl-list}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
 \hline
\textbf{DSL} & \textbf{Java Package}\\
\hline
Regular Expressions & \verb|java.util.regex|\\
XML & \verb|javax.xml|, \verb|org.w3c| and \verb|org.xml|\\
SQL & \verb|java.sql| and \verb|javax.sql|\\
XPath & \verb|java.xml.xpath|\\
XSLT & \verb|javax.xml.transform|\\
RTF & \verb|javax.swing.text.rtf|\\
HTML & \verb|javax.swing.text.html|\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The initial goal of this experiment was simply to provide quantifiable results that are indicative regarding the usage of each {\sc dsl}, thus only files containing Java code were taken into account. Build files or other resources that may contain {\sc dsl}s were not included.

One final assumption was also made; if {\sc xpath} or {\sc xslt} were found in the source code, then the project would be marked that it also uses {\sc xml}, since those two languages are used for query and transformations on {\sc xml} {\sc dom} trees.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rel}

The Maven ecosystem has been previously analyzed by
Raemaekers et al.~\cite{RDV13}
to produce the {\it Maven dependency dataset}.
Apart from basic information like individual methods, classes,
packages and lines of code for every {\sc jar}, this dataset
also includes a database with all the
connections between the aforementioned elements.
Our work differs from this research because it
reports all bugs coming from the output of a
static analysis tool, for each {\sc jar}
contained in the Maven repository.
