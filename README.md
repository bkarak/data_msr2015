Generating the Blueprints of the Java Ecosystem
============

Examining a large number of software artifacts can provide the research community with data regarding quality and design. We present a dataset obtained by statically analyzing 22730 jar files taken from the Maven central archive, which is the de-facto application library repository for the Java ecosystem. For our analysis we used three popular static analysis tools that calculate metrics regarding object-oriented design, program size, and package design. The dataset contains the metrics results that every tool reports for every selected jar of the ecosystem. Our dataset can be used to produce interesting research results, such as measure the domain-specific language usage.
